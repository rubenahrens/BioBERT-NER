# textmining project
 
The final assignment is a research paper. You work in groups of 2 students. You can pick one of the pre-defined four tasks or define your own.

This assignment counts for 30% of the course grade and 60% of the weighted average assignments grade. See http://tmr.liacs.nl/TM.html

Topics:

    Topics to choose from (also see slides of lecture 10):
        Information Extraction
    Resources for each of the tasks:
        CSIRO Adverse Drug Event Corpus (Cadec) (description)
        Data: https://data.csiro.au/collection/csiro:10948 -> CADEC.v2.zip 
        Paper: Karimi et al. (2015) Cadec: A corpus of adverse drug event annotations 

Report:

    8 pages + max 2 pages for references and appendix (research paper).
    Advice: use LaTeX on Overleaf (template suggestion)
    Criteria listed in separate item on Brightspace (under Exam and assignment preparation)

Deadlines:

    November 28: select a topic. You don’t have to send this to us
    December 6: online lab session for practical help with data/code
    December 13 (optional): submit a draft of your introduction, data, and method sections. You don't receive points for completing this step, but it is an opportunity to receive feedback on your work.
    January 5: submit the paper and code.
    If your submission is late, then it will be counted as re-sit (maximum grade: 6). The re-sit deadline is February 9.

This is a group assignment.

 

Report: 8 pages + max 2 pages for references and appendix (research paper)

Advice: use LaTeX on Overleaf. Template suggestion. (If you need more space you can select another one, e.g. ACM 2-column)

 

Structure of the research paper:

    introduction
    background/related work
    data
    methods
    results
    discussion
    conclusion
    contributions of the team members

 

    Your introduction needs to contain a description of the task and your research questions. What is the problem and how will you solve it?
        Come up with your own research question. Formulate it in an open way.
        Suggestions are to compare methods, models, or pre-processing steps/filtering, combine multiple models, analyze the effect of changes in the data on the results, or investigate how you can improve over a baseline by adding your own ideas to the method.
    In your background section you describe a few relevant papers.
    In your data section you provide a description and some statistics of the data. What are the labels and how are they distributed?
    In your methods section you describe what you did and how
    In your results section you provide clear tables with the results, and a description. Don’t forget a baseline comparison
    Add relevant points of discussion (limitations, implications)
    In the conclusion section you answer your research questions

Criteria:

    Introduction and research questions:
        is the problem clear and well motivated?
        is/are the research questions clear and concrete?
    Background/related work: are the literature references relevant and sufficient?
    Data:
        is the data well described?
        are some relevant statistics (such as label distribution) included?
    Method:
        is the method well-explained?
        is the methodology technically sound? (e.g. proper split of train/development/test, comparison to baseline/state-of-the-art)
    Results:
        is the result table clear?
        are the results described properly and concisely?
        are the correct metrics reported?
        are comparisons to a baseline method included?
    Discussion: are relevant points of discussion included? (limitations, implications)
    Conclusion: are the research questions properly answered?
    General: page limit and writing
